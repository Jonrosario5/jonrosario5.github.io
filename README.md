Technologies Used 

- Bootstrap for Porfolio carousel
- Skeleton boilerplate
- Regular CSS and HTML to create responsive Nav 
- Tried Vanilla JS to get the Testimonies to Work 
- FlexBox for responsive Contact Form 


Process/Approach 

I began with trying to create 3 different sites. One with Vanilla JS, one with Bootstrap and one will a hybrid of the two. I was only able to complete the Hybrid. In which it is not fully completed as the testimonies and lightbox are missing. 


Unsolved Problems

- Lightbox
- Testimonies

I could not figure out the setInterval() and setTimeout() methods for getting the testimonies to run on a loop. I was able to loop through the array of testimony objects I created with a constructor. But it would only show the last item in the array. I checked numerous blogs, videos and chat threads but couldn't get a solution to work. 

Biggest Win 

Getting the responsive nav bar to work without JS or Bootstrap. I had to seek assistance from a YouTube video, but it was worth it becasue I learned a new method for making a responsive Nav. The downside of that was it took me 5 hrs to get the technique to work with my code. 

Biggest Challenge

The biggest challenge I faced was the testimonies, I am sure if I went Vanilla JS for the carousel it would have presented the same problem. I now know that I need to work more on my JS DOM manipulation. This project helped me figure out CSS/HTML and Bootstrap for the most part. But now I need to focus on JS and making my code DRY, as I felt I had to repeat myself too much in this project.
